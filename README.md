# Conway's Game of Life implemented in JavaScript (vanilla)

It's evolution over time is solely based on the initial configuration of the board.
Game of Life is originally designed to be simulated on an infinite two dimensional grid.
Each cell can have one of two states, either alive or dead. For every generation(update) 
each cell is checked against a specific set of rules to determine if their state is changed.

### Rules of the game
##### 1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
##### 2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
##### 3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
##### 4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
 
 
#### This game was thought up by mathematician John Horton Conway.
